# CPAN: A pan-genome based method for cancer genomics study

## Introduction
Cancer genomics studies are essentially relied on the human reference genome. However, tens of million base-pairs are still missing in the current human reference genome sequence. Pan-genome analysis has been proved its powerful in plant and human et.al. We expand the pan-genome analysis to study cancer genomes. 
The CPAN homepage is http://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/cpan/CPAN.html.
